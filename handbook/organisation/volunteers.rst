Volunteers
==========

.. note::

   Although your committee members will be volunteers too, the volunteers in this section are the
   helpers who get involved in the running of the event, rather than the team that has organised
   it.

Volunteers are one of the joys of running a conference.

In the Python/Django community, they're readily available. People want to volunteer and help - it's
their conference and they want to be a part of it. Don't underestimate the number of people who'll
be willing to help, or how hard they'll work or effective they will be.

Take advantage of their generosity, and make sure you repay it.

It's better, unless a volunteer comes forward who looks like an excellent candidate, to keep your
committee separate from your pool of other volunteers. Your committee has to stay small, but your
volunteers can be a larger and looser group.


Enlisting volunteers
====================

Just ask for volunteers if you want them, but you'll also find that volunteers approach you
asking if they can help.

Student attendees often make excellent volunteers, so especially if your event has some connection
with a university, you're likely to find some very good recruits amongst them.


Roles for volunteers
====================

You'll need volunteers:

* while setting up
* :doc:`/procedures/bag-packing`
* at :doc:`/procedures/registration`
* on the registration desk during the event
* to act as runners
* while clearing up

None of this work is in the least bit glamorous, but you'll be surprised how willing people are to
take part in it. Obviously, if you just stand around issuing commands at people their willingness
may falter, but in any case you should take a lead by being the first to step in for the worst jobs.


Information
===========

Volunteers need to know what they should do and where they should be; the clearer you can be about
this, the better. It should be in written forms, so that don't have to remember important things
when they are in a rush. A :doc:`/documents/handbook-for-volunteers` will be invaluable.

This should contain:

* information about what happends where and when and who's involved in it
* times and places of all events, including social events
* contact information for all the committee
* a reminder of the code of conduct, and guidance on what to do if there's an issue (see below)


Code of conduct
===============

If there are any code-of-conduct-related problems, volunteers need to know what to do. This should
be:

* look after anyone if they are upset
* gather some basic information such as names
* contact the committee

And that's pretty much it. They should not be expected to investigate or resolve anything. Again,
this should be provided in written form.


Thanking your volunteers
========================

It's important to make it clear what the deal is for volunteers. :doc:`/policies/everybody_pays`, but it's
fair enough to offer a volunteer-rate ticket. Your volunteers deserve to come to a speaker's dinner
if there is one, and don't forget to have them all on stage at the end of the event to receive
thanks from the audience.
